# Downloads_Sorter
Simple python script to sort my downloaded files into specific folders based on their extension

CAUTION!! At the moment you MUST create the Documents, Pictures, Software folder manually. If you do not then the program will destroy your files and create a new file named after the folder you're missing.. The folders are case sensitive!


To use this yourself just change the value of src_dir to the directory you would like to sort and remember to create the sorting folders listed above.

#TODO   
-Create a check to see if sorting folders already exist and create them if they do not.
-Add more file types
