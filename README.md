# Downloads_Sorter
Simple python program to sort files into specific folders based on their extension

This will check the directory you specify and then create folders to sort files into based on their extensions

To use this change the value of `src_dir` to the directory you would like to sort.
```python
src_dir = "C:/Users/example/Desktop/test"
```

You can run this by running the following script in your CMD or Powershell while in the files directory:
```
python main.py
```
